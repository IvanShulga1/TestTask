Hello, I did your test case, I found it simple and at the same time interesting. I did everything according to your test case except that I got a System.Text.Json.JsonException: A possible object cycle was detected, so I had to modify the models a bit. I also added an Extensions folder for a more readable application structure, in this folder I registered UserService and OrderService along with their interfaces. Thank you for the opportunity to show yourself, I hope for our further cooperation.
